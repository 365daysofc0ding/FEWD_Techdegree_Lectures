            <p class="recipe-description">This easy pasta sauce will cook in about the same time it takes to cook some dried pasta in boiling salted water &dash; we are talking about quick and easy options here. These amounts serve 2 but are easy to scale up or down. Remember you want about 75g of dried pasta per person &dash; use whatever shape you have got. Or, check out my super-simple method for fresh pasta, using just flour and water.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>150 g dried spaghetti</li>
                    <li class="highlight"><strong>2 rashers of higher-welfare smoked streaky bacon</strong></li>
                    <li>1/2 tbsp olive oil</li>
                    <li>2 free-range eggs</li>
                    <li>30 g Parmesan cheese, plus extra for grating</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>Cook the pasta in a pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions.</li>
                    <li class="highlight"><strong>Slice the bacon and place in a non-stick frying pan on a medium heat with half a tablespoon of olive oil and a really good pinch of black pepper. Leave it to get super-golden and crispy, tossing occasionally, then turn off the heat.</strong></li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, beat the eggs in a bowl, then finely grate in the Parmesan and mix well.</li>
                    <li>Use tongs to transfer your pasta straight into the pan and toss.</li>
                    <li>Pour the Parmesan eggs into the pan, and keep everything moving, loosening with splashes of the pasta cooking water until you have a silky sauce. Make sure the pan is not too hot otherwise the eggs will scramble.</li>
                    <li>Plate up the pasta, and finish with an extra grating of Parmesan.</li>
                </ol>
