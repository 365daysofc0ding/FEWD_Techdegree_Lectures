    <h2>Spaghetti Carbonara</h2>
    <p>This easy pasta sauce will cook in about the same time it takes to cook some dried pasta in boiling salted water - we're talking about quick and easy options here. These amounts serve 2 but are easy to scale up or down. Remember you want about 75g of dried pasta per person - use whatever shape you've got. Or, check out my super-simple method for fresh pasta, using just flour and water.</p>
